# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create either /etc/ranger/rc.conf
# (system-wide) or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf (per user) and add your custom
# commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Use one of the supported image preview protocols
set preview_images true

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * iterm2:
#   Preview images in full color using iTerm2 image previews
#   (http://iterm2.com/images.html). This requires using iTerm2 compiled
#   with image preview support.
#
#   This feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a
#   width of 8 and height of 11 are used.  To use other values, set the options
#   iterm2_font_width and iterm2_font_height to the desired values.
#
# * kitty:
#   Preview images in full color using kitty image protocol.
#   Requires python PIL or pillow library.
#   If ranger does not share the local filesystem with kitty
#   the transfer method is changed to encode the whole image;
#   while slower, this allows remote previews,
#   for example during an ssh session.
#   Tmux is unsupported.
#
set preview_images_method kitty

# Use a unicode "..." character to mark cut-off filenames?
set unicode_ellipsis true

# Draw borders around columns? (separators, outline, both, or none)
# Separators are vertical lines between columns.
# Outline draws a box around all the columns.
# Both combines the two.
set draw_borders outline

# Disable displaying line numbers in main column.
# Possible values: false, absolute, relative.
